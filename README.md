# kickstarter-campaign-prediction
Data Science Project to predict the success of a Kickstarter campaign

You'll find :

* HTML rendered Notebook with the full EDA (kickstarter_part1_EDA.html)
* HTML rendered Notebook for the second part (selection of features + model training) (kickstarter_part2_features_model_training.html)

* html of the Notebook to see results (kickstarter_predict_success_campaign_final_dataframe_and_training.html)
* html of data report generated with a library (kickstarterds.html)
* Notebook code with no outputs (kickstarter_predict_success_campaign_final_dataframe_and_training.ipynb)
* final cleaned up dataframe data that I use in the Notebook (out2.zip)


This project is accompanying an upcoming blog post and is for demonstration purposes only, the code accompanying the blog post is the shortened version 'kickstarter_predict_success_campaign_final_dataframe_and_training.ipynb'

Tools/Techniques demonstrated :
* EDA, cleaning up data, simple features generation
* pandas-profiling library
* use of scikit-learn pipelines
* saving metrics and models in mlflow
